<p>On the eighth layer of the Nine-Layered Deathlands, a dark cloud shrouded the entire area and a pressuring presence was layered down, giving off a suffocating feeling. Even the golden armored god’s servant couldn’t help backing off. A mysterious energy extended itself towards the Black Infernal Tower.

</p><p>This energy was filled with a frightening bloodlust.

</p><p>As this energy extended towards the Black Infernal Tower, it was intercepted by a second formless energy.

</p><p>*Boom!*

</p><p>A terrifying explosion resounded throughout the entire eighth floor of the Nine-Layered Deathlands.

</p><p>The Nether Master materialised from thin air and fixed his gaze on the space before him. “Zhu Long, why didn’t you inform us that you were coming?”

</p><p>A handsome man slowly emerged from within the dark cloud. He stood high in the sky as a faint white light radiated from his body, like a firefly in the darkness.

</p><p>“Nether, I never thought that we would meet again so soon.” The man that the Nether Master had called Zhu Long had a face that was as cold as ice and brows that seemed as if they had been chiseled in.

</p><p>“I wonder what your business is in coming here?” The Nether Master stood in the air in a very calm and tranquil manner.

</p><p>“Ming, back in the day, you sheltered the humans who entered the Nether Realm, and we, the demon clan, didn’t bother you over it. It wasn’t because we were afraid of you; we were just trying to avoid wrinkling our harmony. I know that the Divine Feathers Sect is backing you. In the Spiritual City of the Draconic Ruins Realm, the Divine Feathers Sect suffered great losses due to the Demon God Sect. You’re aware of how serious it was, and yet you are still planning to continue the battle with my demon clan inside the Tiny World?!”

</p><p>The Nether Master gave Zhu Long a look of disdain and said, “Regardless of how lively the fight is outside, what does it have to do with us? This is the Tiny World. No matter how strong the Demon God Sect is, they’re unable to enter this realm. At least within this Nether Realm, I still hold some degree of authority. The Nine-Layered Deathlands also falls under the jurisdiction of my Nether City. Regardless of how intense the fight is out there, it is all unrelated to me. But inside the Nether Realm, no matter how strong your demon clan is, you’ll still have to abide by the rules of the Nether Realm!”

</p><p>Zhu Long looked at the Nether Master as he coldly snorted, “And what if I don’t abide by them?”

</p><p>“Then I’m afraid I’ll have to kick you out.” The face of the Nether Master was hidden under a black cloth; therefore, his expression couldn’t be seen. Throughout the entire Nether Realm, endless quantities of Law Energy surged like a storm, giving off a suffocating pressure.

</p><p>The Nether Master had been operating in the Nether Realm for tens of thousands of years. Thus, the abundance of Law of Nether here was several tens or possibly even several hundreds fold that of other places. Within this Nether Realm, the Nether Master was the absolute ruler!

</p><p>Zhu Long laughed wildly, “Hahaha! Ming, you’re indeed just as arrogant as you used to be! However, today’s situation is far from it how it was back then. If you’re still being stubborn, then don’t blame me for getting impolite. As long as you hand over Yu Yan, who you’ve been hiding in the Nether Realm, I can let this matter go. Otherwise…”

</p><p>“Zhu Long, how dare you be so arrogant in my Nether Realm! Just exactly which of us did you say was the more arrogant one?” The Nether Master coldly stared at him.

</p><p>The Law Energies of both parties began to contest against one another. The entire eighth floor of the Nine-Layered Deathlands brimmed with the excess power of the two Law Energies. The explosions caused by their collisions engulfed all of the Nether Realm.

</p><p>“It seems your cultivation rose by quite a bit since our previous exchange!” Zhu Long’s mouth curled into a chilling smile as an endless torrent of Law of Ice turned his surroundings into ice dragons. They issued roars of rage and charged at the Nether Master.

</p><p>“</p><p>The same goes for you.” Numerous black spears filled with the Law of Nether materialised around the Nether Master and flew towards Zhu Long.

</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*

</p><p>Havoc wreaked throughout the eighth floor of the Deathlands, turning everything into ruins.

</p><p>A terrifying explosion swept over the ground. Some of the demon beasts on the eighth floor who couldn’t escape in time were engulfed by the blast.

</p><p>On the eighth floor of the Nine-Layered Deathlands, only the Black Infernal Tower still stood intact. The servant who wore the golden armour was also overpowered by the auras of the two experts who represented the pinnacles of cultivation. As he was swept away by the explosion, his golden armor shattered into pieces and wounds appeared all over his body.

</p><p>Both Zhu Long and the Nether Master didn’t move an inch as they stood in the sky. With just the confrontation of their Law Energies, the Law of Ice proceeded to cover the entire floor in a layer of thick ice, instantly turning it into a frozen world.

</p><p>The ice energy constantly attacked the Nether Master.

</p><p>The Nether Master slightly furrowed his brows. Once his Law of Nether gathered together, it only occupied one third of the total space. Zhu Long’s strength has risen so far that it surpassed his previous imagination. At his current level, the Nether Master was already no longer a match for Zhu Long.

</p><p>Suddenly, a thought flashed through the Nether Master’s mind. He stared at Zhu Long and asked in a solemn voice, “You’ve already congealed the seven lotuses?”

</p><p>Zhu Long coldly said, “Correct! Nether, if you are willing to swear allegiance to me, this Tiny World can be ruled by just the two of us. If you still insist on this pointless resistance, then I’ll have no choice but to remove you!”

</p><p>The Nether Master coldly snorted, “If you’ve congealed the seven lotuses, then you are indeed invincible compared to the others in the Tiny World. However, it still won’t be easy to control the entire Tiny World!”

</p><p>“Haha! Are you saying that you’re still capable of causing some turbulence to my plans?” Zhu Long wildly laughed. Suddenly, he sensed two other auras and his expression changed. He stared at the Nether Master, “You’re not alone?”

</p><p>“Naturally,” replied the Nether Master casually.

</p><p>“Fine. I must admit that I’ve underestimated you. Since you’re not alone, I won’t be able to do anything to you, for now. But my demands are still the same. If you hand over Yu Yan, we will join with you and completely control this Tiny World. All the resources here will belong to us. But if you persist on going against us, after I’ve subdued the Spiritual Gods of the other races, where do you think you lot could still run to?”

</p><p>“Zhu Long, your train of thought is too simple. Even if you’re practically invincible in this Tiny World, do you really think that you can control the entire Tiny World alone? My Nether Realm naturally has its own means of self-defense; how can you expect the other two great realms to not have the same? There are still experts from the Abyss Realm and the Lava Realm. Do you really think that you can subdue them? Even though you’re unable to enter the human race’s Dreamcloud Realm, you still plan to dominate the entire Tiny World?” The Nether Master shook his head and laughed, “I’m too lazy to fight with you. Since there isn’t any benefit in doing so, as long as you don’t step into the Nether Realm, then we’ll each mind our own business. However, if you attack, my Nether City isn’t without worthy experts!”

</p><p>Zhu Long took a long look at the Nether Master. It seemed it was impossible for him to bring back Yu Yan this time. He issued a cold snort.

</p><p>“The woman Yu Yan can remain here for the time being. But sooner or later, I will have her captured and taken back!”

</p><p>After speaking, Zhu Long’s figure gradually disappeared without a trace.

</p><p>Sensing that Zhu Long’s aura had disappeared, the Nether Master allowed a trace of blood to flow from the corner of his mouth. In the confrontation of Law Energies just now, he had suffered some injuries.

</p><p>“Are you alright?” Ling Yun appeared beside the Nether Master.

</p><p>The Nether Master shook his head as he said, “Zhu Long is getting stronger and stronger. If I had known that he would one day be this powerful, I would’ve exert all my power to kill him back then. Now that he has congealed the seven lotuses, I’m afraid that even if the seven of us were to work together, we might not be able to defeat him! He doesn’t know our limits and is worried that we might have some cards hidden under our sleeves; therefore, he didn’t dare to be rash. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn’t have let this matter off so easily.”

</p><p>Tian Hun also appeared by the Nether Master’s side. “I never thought that he would be so strong already. I fear that there isn’t anyone in this Tiny World who could keep him in check.”

</p><p>The four others didn’t follow. No one knew if Zhu Long would return; therefore, it’s best if they don’t show their full strength.

</p><p>“In the previous battle between the Divine Feathers Sect and the Demon God Sect, I died three times. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been overpowered by him to such a degree,” the Nether Master said in a solemn voice, “We have to restore our strength as fast as possible. Otherwise, I fear that this Tiny World will end up ruled by him.”

</p><p>The three figures disappeared into the sky.

</p><p><b>Fifth floor of the Black Infernal Tower</b>

</p><p>The two people who were in a confrontation were unable to enter the anatta mental state. After all, that state wasn’t easy to reach. The Demon Lord stood up and glanced at Nie Li and Yu Yan.

</p><p>Nie Li also opened his eyes and gave a guarded stared at the Demon Lord, prepared to face an attack at any moment.

</p><p>The Demon Lord casually glanced at Nie Li and said, “Are you intending on following me to the sixth floor of the Black Infernal Tower?” A chilling bloodlust emanated from the Demon Lord.

</p><p>Nie Li shrugged, “I intend to go later!”

</p><p>The Demon Lord calmly stood up and circled up the stairs, heading for the sixth floor. Nie Li could sense that the Demon Lord was struggling with every step. The black flames continued to pour into the Demon Lord’s body. However, he still managed to confidently make his way up the stairs.

</p><p>“Be careful. Try not to get roasted,” Nie Li’s voice drifted to the Demon Lord as he walked away.

</p><p>The Demon Lord’s steps paused. As he coldly turned his head back towards Nie Li, he looked at him with eyes bursting with murderous intent. Then he turned back and continued upwards.

</p><p>“I was only reminding you out of goodwill, yet I was treated with hostility instead. This guy is really dull.” Nie Li remained seated as he resumed his attempts to comprehend the mental state. Since the Demon Lord was already heading to the sixth floor of the Black Infernal Tower; that meant that he could finally cultivate in peace.

</p><p>Gradually, his consciousness drifted and entered into a profound state within a profound state. His soul slowly emptied out as if he was soaring into the clouds and was riding the fog. Vaguely, Nie Li could see the shape of an egg suspended in the air. The egg was filled with cracks and seemed like it held a type of deep energy that sucked people in.

</p><p>Nie Li could sense that this egg concealed a frightening and powerful creature. An unknown and mysterious ripple of energy gradually spread out. A deep sense of bloodlust and killing intent was blasted towards him.

</p><p>In his previous life, Nie Li could be considered experienced and knowledgeable. He was aware that what he felt now was the power concealed in this creature’s bloodline. Its ancestors experienced countless bloodbaths and the killing aura had been passed down to this one.

</p><p>This kind of killing aura even caused Nie Li to feel fear. He wondered what kind of terrifying creature would appear when he hatches this egg!</p>
