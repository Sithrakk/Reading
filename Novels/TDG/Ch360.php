<p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast is a kind of Dragon Bloodline beast that lives in wind caves. These creatures are born with the power to grasp the wind. The wind blades that they form can smash artifacts of the same level.

</p><p>*Woosh!* *Woosh!* *Woosh!*

</p><p>The wind blades flew towards Nie Li, like the invisible curves of the full moon.

</p><p>A dazzling gold light flickered off of the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon’s body as his aura continued to increase. A blazing heatwave spread throughout the area, coming from the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon. He spat out a blazing dragon breath that collided with the wind blades.

</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*

</p><p>The dragon breath collided with several wind blades.

</p><p>The intense battle continued. Powerful energy wreaked havoc on the stage, threatening to destroy the surrounding barrier.

</p><p>The battle left the students dumbfounded. They weren’t in shock of Guo Huai’s strength; rather they were shocked that Nie Li could hold up for so long against a 9-fate like Guo Huai.

</p><p>After all, Nie Li was just 4-fate. There were five fates of difference between them!

</p><p>To think that Nie Li had hidden so much!

</p><p>Venerable Flameless furiously transmitted his voice over to Guo Huai. “What are you doing?! End him, quickly!”

</p><p>Guo Huai was disheartened. Although Nie Li’s strength was inferior to his, Nie Li was extremely agile in battle. He managed to either dodge or destroy all of Guo Huai’s wind blades. The Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon’s strength greatly surpassed his expectations.

</p><p>*Roar!*

</p><p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast furiously roared as its chest rapidly expanded. His body size doubled as he rapidly gathered majestic Heavenly Energy in his mouth. His move caused a freezing pressure in the surrounding that forced the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon to take several steps back.

</p><p>Wind Cannon of the Nethermoon Draconic Beast!

</p><p>Nie Li was felt a chill in his heart and had to restrain his fear. The Nethermoon Draconic Beast’s Wind Cannon was a highly destructive attack!

</p><p>Nie Li wanted to dodge it, but it was already too late.

</p><p>So fast!

</p><p>The Nethermoon Draconic Beast abruptly spat out a huge wind ball that shot towards the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon.

</p><p>An invisible wind energy locked onto Nie Li and made it hard for him to move, even a little. That massive wind sphere was almost upon him as he struggled to dodged towards the side.

</p><p>*Boom!*

</p><p>That wind cannon grazed past the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon with a huge sound. The terrifying energy swept through and sent the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon flying out.

</p><p>Nie Li suffered the heavy attack directly in his chest, and his limbs and part of his wings were shredded by the frightening energy. Fresh blood splattered everywhere. He flew out, impacting the ground so heavily that he instantly created a huge crater.

</p><p>This Wind Cannon had left Nie Li with a heavy injury.

</p><p>The difference in energy between Nie Li and Guo Huai was just too wide. The Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon emitted a dazzling golden light, as it regenerated its tattered limbs with a clearly visible speed. Among all the Dragon Bloodline demon beasts, the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon undoubtedly has the most powerful physique and also possessed powerful regeneration abilities.

</p><p>However, Guo Huai didn’t give Nie Li any time to catch his breath. His chest and abdomen expanded again and he spat out a second Wind Cannon.

</p><p>The third, fourth, fifth…

</p><p>He launched Wind Cannons ones after another towards the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon, who kept dodging. However, Nie Li was still swept up by the Wind Cannon’s frightening energy.

</p><p>*Bang!* *Bang!* *Bang!*

</p><p>The Wind Cannons’ powerful force continued to hit Nie Li’s body.

</p><p>The Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon was wounded all over. With such heavy injuries, even his regenerative abilities were useless.

</p><p>Indeed, the difference between Nie Li and a 9-fate expert was too wide.

</p><p>After nine consecutive Wind Cannons, the Nethermoon Draconic Beast finally exhausted its strength and stood there, breathing heavily. Guo Huai looked upon the terribly wounded Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon, and the trace of a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. So what if Nie Li’s Dragon Bloodline God Level demon spirit was a mutated one? Nie Li was still going to lose to him!

</p><p>Although the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon’s was powerful, it was still impossible to block the Nethermoon Draconic Beast’s Wind Cannon.

</p><p>Nie Li had suffered heavy injuries and his consciousness was becoming a little fuzzy. He felt a vague sense of nostalgia, as if he’d returned to his battle with the Sage Emperor. Back then, he was already on the edge of exhaustion, and surrounded by six Deity ranked demon beasts. Yet he still forcibly endured the battle. As he fought with those six Deity ranked demon beasts, he was forced to watch the Sage Emperor erase the souls of those who were even slightly related to him.

</p><p>That continued, until Nie Li had thoroughly lost the meaning to his own existence and died in unjust anguish.

</p><p>His rebirth had given him another chance and had returned those people to him. Images of his parents, friends, clansmen, Ye Ziyun, Xiao Ning’er, and everyone else flashed across his mind.

</p><p>He couldn’t retreat here. He couldn’t lose!

</p><p>Without the Temporal Demon Spirit Book, there was no third chance!

</p><p>The reason Nie Li had been cultivating his strength like crazy and expanding his power, was all in preparation for his battle against the Sage Emperor! How could he die here to a measly 9-fate?

</p><p>Everyone who was watching the stage couldn’t help sighing. Nie Li had finally lost. He was still a 4-fate, after all. The fact that he’d confronted a 9-fate existence was already enough to win everyone’s respect!

</p><p>The five auras that observed Nie Li began discussing amongst themselves.

</p><p>“So Nie Li was able to reach this stage! That’s already extremely good!” the solemn voice sounded again.

</p><p>“I’m becoming more and more interested in that kid!” the flirtatious voice chuckled.

</p><p>Without a doubt, Nie Li had displayed a heaven-defying talent. Hierarch Skycloud allowed the faint trace of a smile to show. Perhaps Nie Li would grow to become the new pillar of Divine Feathers Sect and lead them to glory.

</p><p>Gu Bei, Lu Piao, and the rest were all worried for Nie Li. At the sight of this, Gu Bei immediately barked, “We’ll go up and save him!”

</p><p>Just as they were about to take action, Li Xingyun suddenly blocked their way and said, “Wait!”

</p><p>“Li Xingyun, move!” Lu Piao frowned as he growled. He never expected that Li Xingyun would be the one to actually obstruct him at such a critical moment.

</p><p>Suddenly, a huge boom sounded from the stage as a majestic aura soared into the sky.

</p><p>Everyone was slightly shocked as they sensed that frightening ripple of energy. They watched with shocked expressions as the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon release a powerful aura.

</p><p>What was going on?

</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*

</p><p>Several blasts of air exploded, radiating from the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon. This aura was several times more powerful than before!

</p><p>At that moment, the fifth fate soul was forming inside Nie Li’s body. It quietly burned in the center of his soul realm, along with the red, blue, yellow, and black fate souls.

</p><p>5-fate!

</p><p>Usually, when someone moves from 4-fate to 5-fate, their strength would increase by two-folds, if they were lucky. However, Nie Li’s strength had increased by five to six-folds, at the very least!

</p><p>The wounded body of the Bloodwing Saint Jiao-dragon began regenerating at a rapid speed. The originally golden skin grew a metallic sheen that was like black gold. The spikes on its back also became bigger and more solid.</p>
