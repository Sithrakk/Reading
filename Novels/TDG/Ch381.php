<p>That Heavenly Axis Realm expert coldly snorted at Wu Yazi’s attitude.

</p><p>“The three of you! Yeah, I’m calling you trash! Grow a pair of eyes! Otherwise, I’ll slaughter all three of you!” the Heavenly Axis Realm expert shouted as he coldly swept his eyes over Nie Li’s group.

</p><p>Wu Yazi was enraged by that Heavenly Axis Realm’s words.

</p><p>Nie Li patted Wu Yazi on the shoulder and said, “Forget it, let’s just go.”

</p><p>At first, the Heavenly Axis Realm expert was hesitant, because he’d caught a trace of Wu Yazi’s dangerous aura. However, his courage grew back when he saw how weak Nie Li was acting.

</p><p>Wu Yazi was acting all buddy-buddy with a Heavenly Fate Realm; there was no way his cultivation could be that strong.

</p><p>Wu Yazi’s fists were crackling from how hard he was clenching them. One could say that he was quite a figure within the Demon God’s Sect. Who was he to dare call him trash?

</p><p>Wu Yazi angrily pointed at the Heavenly Axis Realm expert and ordered, “You guys, get lost. I’ll give you fifteen minutes. If you aren’t out of my sight by then, I won’t let a single one of you live!”

</p><p>However, that Heavenly Axis Realm only laughed at Wu Yazi’s words. This demon clan kid was just too arrogant and ignorant!

</p><p>Suddenly, Long Tianming noticed the commotion from far away and walked over. “What’s going on?”

</p><p>The Heavenly Axis Realm expert bowed as he replied, “Report to the Young Master. There are three Heavenly Fate Realm demons over here. I ordered them to leave, but they refused to heed.”

</p><p>“Just make them run far enough.” Long Tianming said with indifference. They were only three Heavenly Fate Realm demons. Chasing them away would be enough.

</p><p>Usually, Long Tianming would just kill three Heavenly Fate Realm experts of the demon clan; however, he didn’t want to cause any trouble, since he didn’t know when the entrance to the Void Illusionary Divine Palace would open. He’d already loaned over two hundred of his Heavenly Axis Realm experts to Gu Heng, which meant he had fewer men with him this time. It was in his best interest to keep a low profile.

</p><p>The Heavenly Axis Realm underling turned back to Nie Li’s group of three and growled, “You heard my Young Master. Get lost!”

</p><p>Wu Yazi had finally had it with this arrogant Heavenly Axis Realm expert. Just a while ago, some people had tried to steal from him, so he’d killed a dozen of them. His hands are still sticky from the blood, and here was another bunch of tactless idiots.

</p><p>*Woosh!*

</p><p>Wu Yazi vanished.

</p><p>The Heavenly Axis Realm expert finally recognised the powerful energy that locked onto him, and he sensed the fear of death.

</p><p>He tried to break free, but he couldn’t move at all.

</p><p>Suddenly, a frightening chill ran down his neck. He wanted to cry out, but he couldn’t make a sound.

</p><p>Wu Yazi’s cold voice entered his ears. “Who are you calling trash?”

</p><p>The Heavenly Axis Realm expert didn’t know when it’d happened, but Wu Yazi was already behind him, clutching his throat with two fingers. Wu Yazi exerted a slight amount of force and something exploded.

</p><p>The Heavenly Axis Realm expert’s throat had been crushed. Pieces of his body rained down from above.

</p><p>Long Tianming’s guard of Heavenly Axis Realm experts were instantly enraged by this.

</p><p>“How dare you!”

</p><p>“Kill him!”

</p><p>Over thirty Heavenly Axis Realm experts pounced on Wu Yazi.

</p><p>Wu Yazi glanced back at Nie Li and Xiao Yu and said, “You guys should distance yourself a little!” Then he charged towards the Heavenly Axis Realm experts.

</p><p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*

</p><p>A chaotic battle broke out. Although Wu Yazi was surrounded by over thirty Heavenly Axis Realm experts, he didn’t look like he was at a disadvantage. On the contrary, he’d already killed several enemy Heavenly Axis Realm experts.

</p><p>Xiao Yu stood next to Nie Li and asked, “Nie Li, you did that on purpose, right?”

</p><p>Nie Li nodded. “Of course I did.”

</p><p>“Then shouldn’t we leave, quickly?” Xiao Yu asked. She thought that Nie Li wanted those guys to keep Wu Yazi busy, while they escaped.

</p><p>Nie Li smiled and said, “There’s no need for that. We haven’t entered the Void Illusionary Divine Palace yet. Why should we leave so early?”

</p><p>“Since your motive is to enter the Void Illusionary Divine Palace, why cause such disturbance? Their leader seems to be Long Tianming!” Xiao Yu glanced at the scene. “Do you have a grudge against Long Tianming? Is that why you’re trying to borrow Wu Yazi’s hand, to teach him a lesson?”

</p><p>Nie Li pondered over the question, then replied, “I have no grudges, but I’ve thought carefully about it. There are a lot of things that are definitely tied to Long Tianming. I’ve always suspected that he’s been secretly plotting against us.” Nie Li really did have a feeling that Long Tianming was some kind of scorpion hiding in the dark.

</p><p>Nie Li preferred to deal with people like Gu Heng, who fought openly and from the front. It wasn’t that he was afraid of Long Tianming, but he had to guard against the tricks that Long Tianming was playing from behind the scene.

</p><p>In Nie Li’s previous life, he’d watched the Divine Feathers Sect fall. Back then, Long Tianming was the only one who’d benefited from it. Therefore, Nie Li was being far more vigilant against Long Tianming than Gu Heng or the others.

</p><p>If an opportunity to weaken Long Tianming presented itself, Nie Li definitely wouldn’t let it pass by.

</p><p>No matter how powerful the Demon God’s Sect was, they’d still have to pay a miserable price to destroy the Divine Feathers Sect. However, the Divine Feathers Sect’s greatest threat was actually from within.

</p><p>Nie Li looked out towards Wu Yazi, who was in a heated battle with Long Tianming’s thirty-some-odd Heavenly Axis Realm experts. He moved swiftly and gracefully. The Heavenly Axis Realm experts were turned into bloody masses on the spot and rained down.

</p><p>The more Wu Yazi fought, the bravier he became. Even after killing seven people.

</p><p>The Divine Blooded Raccoon Clan’s vigour was astounding.

</p><p>Nie Li could sense that Wu Yazi’s cultivation was roughly around the 7-stage Heavenly Axis Realm. If you added his Primordial Bloodline to that, it’d be really hard for Long Tianming and his men to deal with him.

</p><p>Long Tianming watched from afar and furrowed his brows. He’d roughly grasped the situation. However, his underling had reported that they were only three Heavenly Fate Realms. So how did such a powerful expert emerge?

</p><p>This enemy’s strength was quite outstanding.

</p><p>Long Tianming glanced at Nie Li and Xiao Yu, then coldly ordered, “Kill those two first!”

</p><p>One Heavenly Axis Realm expert pounced in Nie Li and Xiao Yu’s direction.

</p><p>Although Wu Yazi was busy with Long Tianming’s Heavenly Axis Realm experts, he’d also been keeping an eye on Nie Li and Xiao Yu. He’d helped them complete the Demon Blood Sacrifice in order to enter the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. If Nie Li and Xiao Yu died here, then wouldn’t all his efforts have been in vain?

</p><p>It looked like Wu Yazi was surrounded, but all of a sudden, his figure disappeared and reappeared right in front of Nie Li and Xiao Yu. That expert was still heading towards Nie Li and Xiao Yu; however, Wu Yazi grabbed him with his right hand, slightly exerted a force, and snapped his neck.

</p><p>Long Tianming’s heart trembled at the sight of that. That was the Raccoon Clan’s secret technique. It looks like this demon youth standing before him actually had quite a position within the demon clan!

</p><p>If this Heavenly Axis Realm demon clan youth was trying his best to protect those two, that meant that those two behind him must have quite the positions within the Demon God’s Sect as well!

</p><p>Long Tianming was inwardly furious. All this time, he’d been trying to keep a low profile, so why did trouble still find him anyways?</p>
