<p>An explosion sounded, Wu Man’s fist was an inch away from Ye Mo, but he couldn’t take a step further. He then saw a transparent shield shrouding Ye Mo.

</p><p>At this moment, Ye Mo lightly smiled. The ice gathered onto Wu Man’s body and instantly bound him.

</p><p>“Those who violates my Glory City, will be killed!” Ye Mo coldly barked as his fist landed on Wu Man’s body. The ice shattered and Wu Man flew away with a mouthful of blood.

</p><p>Wu Man never thought that Ye Mo would use such a technique. He’s simply unable to guard against it and was heavily injured.

</p><p>After suffering this attack, even if Wu Man doesn’t die, he’ll be heavily injured. After seeing dozens of Legend rank experts from the Wugui Family charge towards him, Ye Mo did not pursue him. Instead, he retreated without turning his head back to his pursuers.

</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going!” The Legend rank experts from the Wugui Family chased after Ye Mo.

</p><p>Ye Mo had injured Wu Man, how could they let him leave without any harm?

</p><p>However, Ye Mo’s speed was fast and he had quickly entered into the range of the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array.

</p><p>When the Wugui Family launched their attack against Glory City, all of the citizens of Glory City either escaped to the underground shelters and retreated into the range of the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array. The array is like a solid turtle shield that protects everyone within.

</p><p>The dozens of figures stopped outside of the array’s range and did not enter.

</p><p>“There’s something strange about this array, we have to be careful! Ye Han said that this Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array could even kill a Legend rank expert!”

</p><p>“Why should we be afraid of an array? We’ll enter it together.” Wugui Family’s experts discussed. Even if the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array could kill a Legend rank expert, with so many Legend rank experts in their group, there is nothing to be afraid of.

</p><p>One of the Legend rank experts took the lead and entered into the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array.

</p><p>Upon seeing this, the others also entered into the array.

</p><p>These Legend rank experts from the Wugui Family have a rough idea about Glory City’s strength from Ye Han’s mouth. So naturally, they would have contempt towards Glory City. Moreover, even Ye Han has no idea about the true power of the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array!

</p><p>One after another, the Wugui Family’s Legend rank experts charged into the array. In the array’s center, Ye Zong coldly barked as he quickly activated the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array. Tens of thousands of Black Gold rank demon spirits appeared in the air and, instantly, the sky turned dark as an intense fight broke out.

</p><p>Although these people from the Wugui Family have reached Legend rank, inside the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array, they felt a huge restriction placed on them. If it’s just some ordinary Black Gold rank demon spirits, they could kill as many as they want. However, these demon spirits all under the control of the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array. It’s an array that perfectly blended their strengths and weaknesses together and, therefore, won’t be easy to break.

</p><p>No matter what these experts from the Wugui Family tried, they weren’t able to break the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array. Although they can rely on all kinds of methods for the moment so that the array can’t do anything to them, but they can only dream of escaping.

</p><p>“Damn it, what a wretched array is this!”

</p><p>“I already said to be careful and yet you guys still charged in without thinking it through.”

</p><p>The experts from the Wugui Family felt depressed in their hearts. They have been in the Nether Realm since their births and have never seen an array like this before. Although Ye Han mentioned it before, he only said that it has repelled one of the Demon Lord’s men from the Dark Guild. They never imagined that this Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array could trap so many of them at once.

</p><p>Meanwhile, the large army from the Wugui Family had charged into Glory City and started a war with the city guards, causing a chaotic fight.

</p><p>Ye Mo raised his head and saw tens of thousands of Black Gold rank demon spirits surrounding the Legend rank experts of the Wugui Family and was utterly shocked in his heart. Even he has never expected the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array to trap so many Legend rank experts. The power of this far surpassed his imagination.

</p><p>He heard from Ye Zong that this Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array was laid down according to some ancient drawings and that it was Nie Li who could understand these mysterious drawings!

</p><p>Just in this alone, Nie Li made great contributions to Glory City. If he were to become the son-in-law of the Snow Wind Family, there would absolutely be no problem with it.

</p><p>While thinking about that bizarre Nie Li, Ye Mo lightly smiled. He did not stay in one place and immediately started killing the ordinary experts, beginning the massacre. Although they are all Black Gold rank experts, how could they block the attack of a Legend rank expert?

</p><p>Very quickly, the army from the Wugui Family became a mess by Ye Mo alone.

</p><p>Within the Snow Wind Domain, none of the Wugui Family’s ordinary experts will be left alive.

</p><p>Ye Mo’s figure was like a war god that caused the experts of Glory City to burst out in cheers and greatly raised their morale.

</p><p>Watching this scene, the eyes of the Legend rank experts trapped within the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array turned red from anger.

</p><p>“If we don’t escape this array, our army will be annihilated! How are we going to explain this to the Patriarch?!”

</p><p>“Damn this hateful array!”

</p><p>These Legend rank experts charged at the barrier, but weren’t able to break through the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array. Instead, their faces covered with dirt from it.

</p><p>Luckily Nie Li had laid down the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array; otherwise, they would have no idea how to deal with so many Legend rank experts at once. Ye Zong, who is standing in the center of the array, inwardly recalled that Nie Li had once said that even if dozens of Legend rank experts entered this Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array,none of them would be able to escape. Ye Zong originally didn’t believe him, but after witnessing the might of this array, he couldn’t help to sigh incessantly.

</p><p>If it wasn’t for Nie Li, who knows how Glory City might’ve ended up?

</p><p>Ye Zong’s gaze fell onto the experts within the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array. Since these fellas have come, they can only dream of leaving. He has to show the Wugui Family pain so that they don’t get any more ideas about laying their hands on Glory City!

</p><p>Under Ye Zong’s control, the Black Gold rank demon spirits within the array went berserk and pounced towards the Legend rank experts of the Wugui Family.

</p><p><b>In a yard of the City Lord’s Mansion.</b>

</p><p>“Luo Ming, the battle is so intense, are we really not going to take any action?” One of the Legend rank experts from the Jade Seal Family asked.

</p><p>Luo Ming shook his head and said, “Our Jade Seal Family cannot show our faces. Once we do, we’ll bring even more trouble to Glory City. At that time, the Wugui Family will definitely understand that they alone won’t be able to take Glory City for themselves. They might even ally themselves with other families to attack Glory City!”

</p><p>The two other Legend rank experts nodded their heads.

</p><p>After coming to Glory City, they fell in love with it. This place is even more suitable for humans to live on compared to the Nether Realm! Furthermore, there is so much more cultivating resources. The Jade Seal Family doesn’t have to force their way into this city, if they could move into Glory City, the Glory City would probably be gladly accept it. Afterall, they are all from the human race and there are sufficient space here! Therefore, Luo Ming and the other two don’t wish to see Glory City taken away by the Wugui Family.

</p><p>Nie Li, who was currently cultivating in the center of the inscription pattern array, opened his eyes and swept his gaze over the surrounding area. Ye Ziyun, Xiao Ning’er and the rest were still immersed in their training and everything happening in the outside world didn’t disturb them.

</p><p>He looked into the distant sky and saw dozens of Legend rank experts from the Wugui Family trapped inside the Ten Thousand Demonic Beast Array. With the might of the array, it’ll be extremely tough for those Legend rank experts to break out of it.

</p><p>This batch of experts from the Wugui Family still couldn’t do anything to Glory City. This time, they will probably suffer disastrous loss, and Nie Li and his friends probably don’t have to take any action, which means that they can just nicely conceal their strength.

</p><p>However, there was still a strong sense of urgency in Nie Li’s heart. When Glory City annihilates these experts, the Wugui Family will definitely not let this outcome go so easily. Before long, there will be a second batch of experts that will come to Glory City.</p>
