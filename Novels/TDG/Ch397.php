<p>The massacre intensified as everyone scrambled for the Ganges Crystals.

</p><p>Yan Yang looked down at the corpses that carpeted the ground. Strands of energy flowed off the bodies and into the earth.

</p><p>He then looked to the frenzy, where people were slaughtering each other and snatching after the Ganges Crystals. Something wasn’t right.

</p><p>“Everyone, return! Leave the Ganges Crystals. Follow me!” Yan Yang commanded as he flew in a separate direction.

</p><p>The members of the Skyblaze Sect were confused, as they didn’t know why Yan Yang would make such an order. However, they still followed him.

</p><p><b>Heart of the Main Hall</b>

</p><p>Nie Li looked around him, but didn’t find any Ganges Crystals in the main hall. He moved through a small door as he headed for the depths of the hall.

</p><p>At the far end of the hall stood dozens of statues, all covered in inscription patterns.

</p><p>The corner of Nie Li’s mouth twitched into a smile. According to his calculations, one statue among these dozens should be the right one.

</p><p>These statues could’ve easily fool anyone but Nie Li. He stood still as he thought things through.

</p><p>As Nie Li pondered, the towering crystal jade wall suddenly crumbled and a long passage opened before the eyes of everyone who was cultivating.

</p><p>The crowd was stunned.

</p><p>No matter how they’d tried, they could never enter the crystal jade wall. So why did it suddenly open all on its own?

</p><p>“Let’s go!”

</p><p>“Go in and take a look!”

</p><p>*Woosh!* *Woosh!* *Woosh!*

</p><p>One expert after another rushed through the entrance. In their minds, the Void Illusionary Divine Palace must conceal endless treasures.

</p><p>The life gate also opened and torrents of experts rushed through.

</p><p>Nie Li walked past one statue after another. He’d already determined that those seven weren’t the right ones.

</p><p>A deep and enraged snort sounded from the depths of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. “Who dares to disturb me? Leave this instant! Otherwise, don’t blame me for getting impolite!”

</p><p>The voice boomed like a thunderclap.

</p><p>Nie Li looked up into the depths of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. “Who are you?”

</p><p>The voice responded with a chilling murderous intent. “I am the Void Illusionary Divine Palace! Everything inside is controlled by me. If I wanted to, I could turn every living creature inside here into ashes. You should not be here. Leave now!”

</p><p>“Oh!” Nie Li nodded. He kept examining these statues.

</p><p>The voice grew more enraged. “Do you understand words? Get lost! Or else, don’t blame me for getting impolite!”

</p><p>Nie Li calmly replied, “Well in that case, you don’t have to bother about being impolite. I’m just a Heavenly Fate Realm, after all. It’s not a big deal even if I die.”

</p><p>Nie Li had totally discarded his cares for life and death!

</p><p>The voice went silent for a brief moment before it said, “If you’re not afraid of death, why not fight for the Ganges Crystals in the outer hall? That way, you’d get a chance to obtain the treasures concealed within the Void Illusionary Divine Palace!”

</p><p>“I’m just a lowly Heavenly Fate Realm, while the people outside are at least of the Heavenly Star or Axis Realms. How could I possibly compete with them?” Nie Li took a few steps forward. The eighth statue didn’t look right either.

</p><p>The voice continued to reason. “Just because you’re a Heavenly Fate Realm doesn’t mean you don’t have a chance. I’ve hidden hundreds of thousands of Ganges Crystals in one of the secret chambers out in the main hall. If you listen to my instructions, I’ll lead you to them. That way, you can easily obtain the Void Illusionary Divine Palace’s treasures!”

</p><p>“Really?” Nie Li said in astonishment.

</p><p>“Of course!” the voice responded. “I am only a strand of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace’s intent. I have no use for such treasures. Why would I lie?”

</p><p>“What kinds of treasures are hidden inside the Void Illusionary Divine Palace?” Nie Li approached the ninth statue. It didn’t look to be the array’s crucial point either.

</p><p>The voice responded with temptation. “There are tons of treasures in the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. There are tens of millions of gold spiritual stone essences alone. On top of that, there’re countless artifacts. Just a small portion of them would rival the great wealth of a single divine sect!”

</p><p>“But I’m not interested in those!” Nie Li responded, as he continued to study the statues.

</p><p>“Aside from treasures, there are also many ancient divine artifacts inside the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. Powerful, ancient divine artifacts. All it takes is a drop of blood and a claim of ownership. Then, you could wield them and possess great strength!” the voice continued.

</p><p>Nie Li shook his head. “Not interested!”

</p><p>“Then, what are you interested in?!” the voice’s tone was solemn and coldly angered.

</p><p>“I think these statues are rather interesting. You see, I’m actually a travelling minstrel!” Nie Li replied as he studied the inscription patterns on the statue before him with great interest.

</p><p>Suddenly, Nie Li’s eyes were attracted to one of the statues’ legs. It was a stray piece of gold spiritual stone essence.

</p><p>It was only a single piece, not some shocking wealth. However, it was still better than nothing. Nie Li bent down and picked it up.

</p><p>The moment he did so, the voice changed to an ear-shattering hysteria.

</p><p>“Put down that gold spiritual stone essence! It’s mine!”

</p><p>“If you dare to take it away, I’ll kill you!”

</p><p>“Everything in this Void Illusionary Divine Palace belongs to me! It’s mine! All mine! No one is allowed to touch them! Whoever touches it will be killed! Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill! I’ll kill all of you! No one is allowed to take my treasures away…” The voice wailed, like a demonic note entering Nie Li’s ears.

</p><p>Nie Li was still holding the gold spiritual stone essence in his right hand as he furrowed his brows at the ear-piercing voice. It almost destroyed his eardrums.

</p><p>It was only a single piece of gold spiritual stone essence. Was there really a need to get so emotional?

</p><p>Suddenly, an idea came to Nie Li and the corner of his mouth twitched. He went back to studying the statues.

</p><p>“Did you not hear me? Put it down and beat it! Otherwise, I’ll give you a tragic end!” The voice snarled, like a shrew shouting curses on the street.

</p><p>Nie Li wasn’t bothered in the least; he was focusing on the statues’ inscription patterns.

</p><p>One figure after another smoothly flew into the main hall and charged forward without the least sign of hinderance.

</p><p>“This is already the main hall!”

</p><p>“Where are the palace’s treasures?”

</p><p>They searched around hurriedly before they discovered a small door, tightly shut.

</p><p>“Could it be here?”</p>
