<p>Ye Xuan didn’t know why, but his heart couldn’t stop thumping wildly when he saw Xiao Ning’er’s smile.

</p><p>From a distance, Nie Li’s eyes also found Xiao Ning’er and Xiao Xue. Xiao Ning’er seemed to have grown more beautiful!

</p><p>As Xiao Ning’er walked towards Nie Li, she widened her stride to cover the distance of three steps into only two.

</p><p>“Ning’er!” Nie Li casually smiled. It’d been several months since they parted, and Nie Li’s heart missed her a lot as well.

</p><p>Xiao Ning’er’s eyes flickered with tears. She suddenly took several huge steps and dived into Nie Li’s embrace. Bathed by his aura, she felt peaceful and at ease.

</p><p>Nie Li was surprised, but quickly recovered and patted her on the shoulders. He asked concernedly, “Has anyone in the Heavenly Note Sect bullied you? If anyone’s bullied you, I’ll take care of them for you!”

</p><p>“No.” Xiao Ning’er wiped the tears from her face as she raised her head towards Nie Li. All this time, while she was in the Heavenly Note Sect, she often thought of Nie Li. Now that he was finally before her, her heart was extremely happy! “How are you guys doing in the Divine Feathers Sect?’

</p><p>“Pretty good.” Nie Li casually smiled. He wasn’t quite sure how to put it, both the good and the bad. To him, who’d experienced both life and death from his previous existence, all the events of the Divine Feathers Sect could only be considered trifling matters.

</p><p>Xiao Ning’er looked absolutely charming and lovely in her white dress. All the bystanders of the side chamber felt jealous as they watched the pair.

</p><p>Nie Li and Xiao Ning’er chatted as though no one else was present. They hadn’t realised that everyone’s attention was directed at them.

</p><p>“Who’s that youth?”

</p><p>“You don’t know? That’s the most dazzling genius among the newcomers. He managed to train Long Yuyin into obedience!”

</p><p>“So that’s him!”

</p><p>Since the beginning, Xiao Ning’er had already attracted many people’s gazes. She was a goddess whom no one dared to approach. But now, everyone realised that she was already taken! She was actually taken by Nie Li!

</p><p>Strange expressions crossed the faces of everyone in the hall.

</p><p>Long Yuyin stood from afar, watching Xiao Ning’er. She had to admit that Xiao Ning’er’s elegance and beauty made herself inferior. Just who was she to Nie Li? Long Yuyin didn’t know why, but she couldn’t help feeling frustrated as she clutched her cup of wine and downed it in one go.

</p><p>Li Xingyun only lightly smiled at the scene. Nie Li had done plenty of secret business transactions with him, which greatly strengthened his own faction. He was beginning to see this cooperation with Nie Li with more and more importance. Since Nie Li was so capable, of course it wouldn’t be strange for him to have a few beauties at his side.

</p><p>When Murong Yu saw that it was actually Nie Li, his eyes narrowed and emitted chilling rays of light. He never thought he’d encounter Nie Li here. ‘Enemies travel on a narrow path’ indeed. At an event like this, he couldn’t bully Nie Li, even if he wanted to. Back when he heard that Xiao Ning’er was from the Tiny World, he had some guesses. However, he never thought that Xiao Ning’er would actually turn out to be Nie Li’s woman.

</p><p>Ye Xuan couldn’t help smiling bitterly when he saw Xiao Ning’er dive into Nie Li’s embrace. No wonder Xiao Ning’er didn’t even look twice at him while they travelled here. It turned out that her heart already belonged to someone else.

</p><p>Murong Yu smiled at Ye Xuan. “Senior Brother Ye Xuan, it looks like this Xiao Ning’er is already taken.”

</p><p>Ye Xuan sighed. “Since that’s the case, then I’ll just forget it.” Although he adored Xiao Ning’er, he wasn’t so completely infatuated that he simply had to have her. Since she already had someone else in her heart, the only thing he could do was back off.

</p><p>Murong Yu smiled. “Brother Ye Xuan seems to be lacking some positive outlook. That Nie Li hasn’t even reached the Heavenly Fate Realm yet. He doesn’t have any family background either. The only thing he can do is rely on his words to coax naïve girls. Brother Ye Xuan is just going to back off?”

</p><p>Murong Yu’s words piqued Ye Xuan’s interest. “Oh? He hasn’t even reached the Heavenly Fate Realm yet?” How could such a youth have managed to make a girl like Xiao Ning’er fall in love with him?

</p><p>That youth was obviously unfit for her!

</p><p>Nie Li could sense strange glares from the people around him, but he wasn’t bothered by them. In his eyes, they were nothing more than passerby.

</p><p>Nie Li tossed a glance to he side, he saw Xiao Xue already scolding Lu Piao. He couldn’t help smiling at the scene. So the two sweethearts have reunited.

</p><p>Nie Li made introductions. “This is my friend, Gu Bei.”

</p><p>“Nice to meet you, sister-in-law,” Gu Bei chuckled.

</p><p>Xiao Ning’er’s face flushed at Gu Bei’s words. She raised her head and snuck a glance at Nie Li, while her cheeks boiled. However, she didn’t correct him as she replied, “It’s nice to meet you, too.”

</p><p>Suddenly, a realisation dawned on Gu Bei. Seems like it should be more or less it.

</p><p>The group walked over to an empty table in a corner of the chamber and sat down.

</p><p>Nie Li looked at Ning’er and quietly asked, “Ziyun didn’t come with you?”

</p><p>“She’s currently cultivating in the Heavenly Note Sect’s secret training grounds. I couldn’t contact her before we came here,” Xiao Ning’er explained.

</p><p>“Oh.” Nie Li nodded as he looked into the distance, wondering what kind of secret training grounds they were and how Ziyun was doing.

</p><p>Suddenly, Li Xingyun walked over to them. He looked at Nie Li and asked, “Can I sit here?”

</p><p>“Sure,” Nie Li smiled.

</p><p>Gu Bei and Li Xingyun exchanged looks with their greetings. Although Gu Bei and Li Xingyun had heard of each other before, they rarely interacted. This was their first time meeting through Nie Li.

</p><p>“Can we sit here too?” Ye Xuan and Murong Yu walked over as they pointed at the two empty seats next to Xiao Ning’er.

</p><p>Xiao Ning’er couldn’t help furrowing her brows a little at the sight of Ye Xuan. On the trip here, Ye Xuan kept trying to talk to her, while she didn’t pay much attention him. She was too smart not to notice his intentions. However, this Ye Xuan still had manners; he was refined and courteous. Therefore, Ning’er didn’t harbor any ill will towards him. It was only after Ye Xuan suddenly came over and tried to sit down next to her that she became worried that Nie Li might misunderstand.

</p><p>“That seat is mine!” Xiao Xue promptly sat down next to Xiao Ning’er.

</p><p>Xiao Ning’er couldn’t help giving Xiao Xue a grateful look. Xiao Xue returned the smile. Along this trip, she understands the heart of Xiao Ning’er the most.

</p><p>“Well then, I’ll sit here.” Ye Xuan paused for a moment, then sat with Murong Yu at the opposite end of the table.

</p><p>Meanwhile, as Gu Bei was about to sit beside Nie Li, Long Yuyin sat down first. Gu Bei was stunned for a moment, then bitterly smiled. It looks like he had to find a different place to sit. Long Yuyin was a famed tigress, so, of course, he wouldn’t want to provoke her over such a small matter.

</p><p>The entire side chamber bustled as disciples of the three sects chatted and exchanged insights towards the Martial Dao. Naturally, there would also be few upset confrontations. After Nie Li and his group sat down, people stopped paying attention to them.

</p><p>Xiao Ning’er looked at Long Yuyin, who sat next to Nie Li, and wondered just who this girl was.

</p><p>Ye Xuan raised a cup of wine with a graceful and well-mannered disposition. “During today’s banquet, the higher-ups of the three sects have allowed us to get to know each other. So that we can look after one another in the future, when we finally step into the outside world. I, Ye Xuan, will toast the first cup to everyone. Now that we’ve met, we’re all friends!”

</p><p>However, everyone only afforded Ye Xuan a cursory glance, then continued their own conversations. No one bothered about him, leaving him in a rather awkward situation.

</p><p>At this table, no one regarded Ye Xuan really highly, whether it was Li Xingyun, Long Yuyin, or Gu Bei. Nie Li was still talking to Xiao Ning’er, and hadn’t even taken the time to exchange greetings with Ye Xuan. Who the hell was that guy, anyways?

</p><p>As for Xiao Xue and Lu Piao, the two of them were making a racket like a pair of newlyweds.

</p><p>The corner of Murong Yu’s mouth curled into an almost unnoticeable smile. What he wanted to see was a conflict between Ye Xuan and Nie Li. Murong Yu raised his cup towards Nie Li. “Back there, in the Ghastly Ruins, I didn’t know who Junior Brother Nie Li was. Today, I apologise for any offence I may have caused towards Junior Brother!”

</p><p>Nie Li narrowed his eyes at Murong Yu’s words. Nie Li hadn’t mentioned their encounter in the Ghastly Ruins, and he certainly hadn’t expected Murong Yu to bring it up first. Nie Li looked at Murong Yu’s smile. How was that an apology? That was obviously made to provoke him!

</p><p>Neither did Lu Piao nor Gu Bei expression looked good. They were well aware of what had happened in the Ghastly Ruins.

</p><p>However, Nie Li remained calm and collected. Of course he wouldn’t let himself be so easily enraged. “Senior Brother Murong must be joking. As a 5-fate senior, you only gave me some pointers that I needed. I hope to run into you again, sometime, in the Ghastly Ruins!” Next time Nie Li entered the Ghastly Ruins, he’d definitely challenge Murong Yu!

</p><p>Murong Yu’s expression turned cold as he smiled. “Of course, I’ll welcome you anytime.” Did Nie Li want another beating?

</p><p>At that point, Li Xingyun lazily interjected from the sidelines. “Murong Yu, you’ve challenged me so many times, but I always go easy on you. Otherwise, who knows how many times I would’ve wasted you already? Do you still remember what happened last time? I told you to scram far away from me. It looks like your memory doesn’t work too well! To think you’d actually appear before me again!”

</p><p>Murong Yu’s voice turned slightly sluggish. Nie Li was the strongest of the new year, Murong Yu was the strongest of the previous year, and Li Xingyun was the strongest from the year before that. Murong Yu had challenged Li Xingyun many times, but still couldn’t win. Murong Yu could use words to mock Nie Li, but in front of Li Xingyun he couldn’t even raise his head.

</p><p>Ye Xuan smiled, “This must be Brother Xingyun. I’ve heard my father speak of you often. Our Ye Clan of the Skyblaze Sect and your Ashen Flames Family of the Divine Feathers Sect could be called long-time friends.”

</p><p>Li Xingyun’s heart quaked upon hearing Ye Xuan’s words. So this was someone from the Ye Clan of the Skyblaze Sect. Within the Skyblaze Sect, the Ye Clan was definitely an enormous figure that wielded sixty-percent of the power.

</p><p>Li Xingyun tapped his fingers on the surface of the table, then lightly asked, “May I ask, how should I address you?”

</p><p>“Ye Xuan.” Ye Xuan proudly announced.

</p><p>At that, Li Xingyun understood the situation even more clearly. He’d heard one or two about the Ye Clan at one point or another. This Ye Xuan was one of the direct descendants, and held a status that not even Li Xingyun could compare to. Since they were currently in Divine Feathers Sect territory, of course, Li Xingyun wouldn’t fear Ye Xuan. However, he wouldn’t be able to suppress him either.</p>
